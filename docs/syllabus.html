        <h3>Artificial Life</h3>
        Christopher Langton is generally credited with <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/26022" title="in his paper: 'Studying artificial life with cellular automata'">coining the term</a> <a title="Also known as ALife, Alife, A-Life, alife, etc.">Artificial Life</a> in 1986, followed the next year by the first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/29/science/artificial-life-can-computers-discern-the-soul.html" title="New York Times coverage of 'Artificial Life: an Interdisciplinary Workshop on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems', September 1987">Artificial Life Conference</a> in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Broadly speaking, ALife is concerned with studying fundamental principles of "life as it could be" (LAICB), rather than arbitrarily limiting the scope of study to life as it happened to appear on Earth ("life as we know it": LAWKI). <!-- ALife is not so much a discipline a discipline like physics, chemistry, or biology, but more of a perspective, philosophy, or meta-discipline. -->

      <h3>
        For Students
      </h3>

      <p>
        Welcome to CLASS! CLASS is intended to empower students' first emergence into the complex world of artificial life. Throughout the course students will gain a broadened perspective on living systems and life-like processes from an abstracted, general perspective. We'll discuss big ideas about life (what is it? how did it arise? what would it be like if it happened elsewhere?...), science (how can we make sense of this vast universe?), and complexity (what makes something more interesting than the activity of its parts?).
      </p>

      <p>
        CLASS 2025 is our prototype for ongoing education efforts. It will be part survey, discussing a wide range of ways researchers brig an artificial life perspective to their work, and part project. Our <strong>concrete goal</strong> is for students to <strong>come up with an idea</strong> about one of the ALife systems we've developed for CLASS, and design and run a simple experiment to <strong>test it</strong>. Our <strong>non-objective</strong> (and <strong>the most important part of CLASS</strong>) is to <strong>explore ALife</strong></a>. <span style="color: white">Diversity and curiosity are important concepts in ALife, and have led to the development of algorithms like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909" style="color: white">MAP-Elites</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies" style="color: white">Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies</a>, which have had significant impact on machine learning.</span> <br>
        This <a href="syllabus.html" title="this page">syllabus</a> and the <a href="entree_toc.html">CLASS slides</a> will be updated and adapted throughout the summer workshop. There may be extra info and resources hidden as Easter eggs.

          Students spend roughly equal amounts of time with each system, and start to think about experimental questions they might want to investigate.

      We'll split this session into two parts, separated by a break. In the first we'll try to narrow down student ideas into a simple and concrete experiment. In the second part, we'll set up the experiment and try running it.
